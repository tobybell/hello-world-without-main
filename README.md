# Hello World Without Main

This is a tiny example program demonstrating a functioning C program without a
main function. It implements "Hello, world!" using pure assembly instructions
and without linking to any library code.

The program in this repo is written to run on MacOS, and will not work on Linux
or Windows, since it relies on the MacOS system call interface.

## Getting Started

After cloning on MacOS, run

```bash
make
./main
```
